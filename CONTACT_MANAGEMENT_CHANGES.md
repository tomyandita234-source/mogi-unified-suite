# Contact Management System Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement a complete contact management system with CRUD functionality in the admin panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### Contact Controller (`server/controllers/contactController.js`)

-   Fixed Prisma client initialization
-   Added functions for retrieving contact messages:
    -   `getAllContactMessages()` - Get all contact messages (admin only)
    -   `getContactMessageById()` - Get a specific contact message by ID (admin only)
    -   `deleteContactMessage()` - Delete a contact message (admin only)

#### Contact Routes (`server/routes/contactRoutes.js`)

-   Added authentication and authorization middleware
-   Added new endpoints:
    -   `GET /api/contact` - Get all contact messages (admin only)
    -   `GET /api/contact/:id` - Get contact message by ID (admin only)
    -   `DELETE /api/contact/:id` - Delete contact message (admin only)

#### Authorization Middleware (`server/middleware/authorizeAdmin.js`)

-   Created new middleware to restrict access to admin users only

#### Prisma Schema (`server/prisma/schema.prisma`)

-   Added Contact model with fields:
    -   id (Int, autoincrement)
    -   name (String)
    -   email (String)
    -   phone (String, optional)
    -   message (String, Text type)
    -   createdAt (DateTime, default now)

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### API Client (`src/lib/api.ts`)

-   Added ContactMessage interface
-   Added admin functions:
    -   `ContactAPI.getAll()` - Get all contact messages
    -   `ContactAPI.getById()` - Get contact message by ID
    -   `ContactAPI.delete()` - Delete contact message

#### Admin Page (`src/pages/Admin.tsx`)

-   Added contacts state management
-   Added new "Contact Messages" tab
-   Implemented contact message display with delete functionality
-   Added fetchContacts() function to load contact messages
-   Added handleDeleteContact() function to delete contact messages

## Functionality

### Public Functionality

-   Users can submit contact messages through the contact form
-   Messages are saved to the database
-   Email notifications are sent (if SMTP is configured)

### Admin Functionality

-   Admins can view all contact messages in the admin panel
-   Admins can delete contact messages
-   Contact messages are displayed with:
    -   Name
    -   Email
    -   Phone (if provided)
    -   Message content
    -   Submission date

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

-   `POST /api/contact` - Submit a contact message

### Admin Endpoints

-   `GET /api/contact` - Get all contact messages
-   `GET /api/contact/:id` - Get contact message by ID
-   `DELETE /api/contact/:id` - Delete contact message

## Security

-   All admin endpoints require authentication
-   Admin endpoints require admin role authorization
-   Input validation and sanitization for all contact form fields
-   Rate limiting on contact form submissions

## Testing

The system has been tested and verified to work correctly:

-   Contact messages are properly saved to the database
-   Admin panel displays contact messages correctly
-   Admins can delete contact messages
-   All API endpoints function as expected
